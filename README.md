# wikipedia-scraper
Wikipedia scraper implemented in python with TUI and support for multiple languages
It uses the "requests" library for scraping the HTML of wikipedia.org. And "BeautifulSoup4"(BS4) for parsing the HTML.

Files "languages.txt" and "translations.txt" are supposed to be read by the program, and thereby not intended to be read by users.
